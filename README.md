# Hi, I'm Oliver

I'm a student with a strong interest in **Site Reliability Engineering** and how large-scale systems stay reliable, observable, and efficient.

Right now, I'm focused on building solid fundamentals in systems, networking, and automation, and learning by experimenting, breaking things, and fixing them.

---

## What I'm Learning

- Linux fundamentals (processes, filesystems, permissions)
- Basic networking (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP)
- Bash and Python for automation
- Git and version control workflows
- Monitoring concepts (metrics, logs, alerts)

---

## Projects & Practice

Most of my repositories are small experiments or learning projects, such as:

- Scripts to automate system tasks
- Simple monitoring or logging experiments
- Notes and examples from things I’m studying
- Practice projects based on real-world SRE concepts
- Random Projects

I focus on understanding *why* things work, not just making them work.

---

## Interests

- Reliability and uptime
- Debugging and incident analysis
- Infrastructure and backend systems
- How failures happen in distributed systems

---

## Goals

- Build strong systems fundamentals before jumping into complex tools
- Learn from real-world SRE practices and postmortems
- Contribute to open-source projects in the future

---

## Currently Reading / Learning From

- Engineering blogs (Google SRE, Netflix, Cloudflare)
- Linux and networking documentation
- Open-source projects and their issue discussions

---

Thanks for checking out my profile.
